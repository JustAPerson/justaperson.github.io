        <h1>Achieving a Static IP Using a Free Proxy</h1><time>December 23, 2019</time></header><p>At MIT, it&rsquo;s fairly trivial to get a static IP address (and subdomain under
<code>mit.edu</code>) for a specific MAC address connected to their wired Ethernet network
just by emailing the IT department. Having a static IP address is very
convenient for hosting websites and game servers, but more importantly it allows
easy access to my strong desktop computer from anywhere via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell">SSH</a>. Sadly, my
living situation has changed and I no longer have a simple static IP address for
my desktop.</p>
<p>There are two concerns to be addressed here: a static public IP address and port
forwarding. Let&rsquo;s start with the former. I have recently moved into an apartment
where there is only one choice of internet service provider. They offer a
reasonable consumer plan of 100Mbit/s for $40/mo with a dynamic IP. Their
cheapest business plan with a static IP is 50Mbit/s for $100/mo. Not a great
deal.</p>
<p>Now, I could probably get by with purchasing a domain and reconfiguring DNS
records every time my dynamic IP changed. For some situations, your IP address
will only change when your ISP-provided modem has been disconnected for a
long-enough time period, like during a sustained power outage. For other
situations, like where your ISP employs <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier-grade_NAT">carrier grade NAT</a>, it may
happen more frequently. Ultimately, I don&rsquo;t know how frequently my public IP
address changes, and I&rsquo;d prefer not to care.</p>
<p>Now onto the second concern: port forwarding. Regardless of my ISP&rsquo;s network
situation, we have a wireless router in our apartment for connecting multiple
devices. Thus, even if I can reliably determine our public IP address, I must
configure our router to forward connections on certain ports to my computer. I
don&rsquo;t control this router, and I&rsquo;d prefer not to have to repeatedly badger my
roommate whenever I want to test out new services. If my ISP did employ another
layer of NAT, then this wouldn&rsquo;t help anyway.</p>
<p>Both of these concerns can be addressed simultaneously using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server">proxy</a> and SSH
reverse port forwarding.</p>
<p>A commonly used flag of <code>ssh</code> is <code>-L</code>, which listens on a port of the local
machine and forwards traffic as if it originated from the remote machine. One
can also use the <code>-R</code> flag to do the opposite: to listen on the remote machine
and forward traffic as if it originated on the local machine.</p>
<p>First we will need a proxy server. You can use any host, but Google appears to
be the only major cloud provider offering an indefinite free VM at this
time<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. You&rsquo;ll have to search for another website to describe the in-depth
steps for setting up an <code>f1-micro</code> instance on Google&rsquo;s cloud.</p>
<p>The basic steps for any cloud provider are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create the tiniest uninterruptible VM possible</li>
<li>Add a small hard drive if necessary</li>
<li>Select a linux distribution you&rsquo;re familiar with</li>
<li>Configure an SSH key</li>
<li>Configure the network rules (see below)</li>
</ol>
<p>You have a choice when configuring network rules. If you use the server-optimized
version of Ubuntu chosen by most providers, it will already come with a firewall
that will block all ports besides ssh<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. This is separate from your providers
network rules, which can also block traffic destined for your VM. I would
recommend setting your cloud provider&rsquo;s network rules to accept traffic from all
IP addresses destined to any port. Then you only have to mess with the software
firewall<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Now you can launch the VM. It will be given a static IP address that will last
until the VM is terminated. Given the reliability of modern cloud data centers,
that means you now effectively have a permanent static IP.</p>
<h1 id="setting-up-a-specific-port">Setting Up a Specific Port</h1>
<p>Say you want to run a web server on port <code>80</code>. First you need to set up the
proxy VM. This involves two things: opening the port in the software firewall
and also set up permissions for listening on that port. For Linux, a process
requires root privileges, or more specifically the <code>CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE</code>
capability, to listen to a port below <code>1024</code>. I went with just logging in as
root<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>, but in theory you can use the <code>setcap</code> utility on <code>/usr/sbin/sshd</code>
instead.</p>
<p>In order to log in as root, on my VM I ran:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">sudo mkdir /root/.ssh/
sudo cp ~/.ssh/authorized_keys /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
</code></pre></div><p>You may also want to double check that your <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code> lists
<code>PermitRootLogin</code> as <code>prohibit-password</code>.</p>
<p>Now you should open the port on your VM:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">sudo iptables -w -A INPUT -p tcp --dport <span class="m">80</span> -j ACCEPT
</code></pre></div><p>Now on your server in your local network, run the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">ssh -N -R <span class="s2">&#34;*:80:localhost:80&#34;</span> root@your.vm.ip.here
</code></pre></div><p>Remove the <code>root@</code> portion of the destination IP address if you chose to use the <code>CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE</code> capability.</p>
<p>The <code>-N</code> flag says that SSH doesn&rsquo;t need to run a command on the destination; it
will remain connected indefinitely. The syntax of the <code>-R</code> flag is <code>-R [bind_address:]port:host:hostport</code>. The <code>bind_address</code> of <code>*</code> means listen on
all network interfaces, the <code>port</code> is the port to listen to on the proxy VM, and
the <code>host</code> and <code>hostport</code> are the destination of the traffic once it has been
forwarded back to your local server. You can use the <code>-R</code> flag multiple times to
listen on multiple ports simultaneously.</p>
<p>For a basic attempt at reliability in the face of network interruptions, I wrap that command in this small script:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="cp">#!/bin/bash
</span><span class="cp"></span><span class="k">while</span> true<span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">do</span>
  <span class="nb">echo</span> connecting
  ssh -N -R <span class="s2">&#34;*:80:localhost:80&#34;</span> root@your.vm.ip.here
  <span class="nb">wait</span> <span class="m">3</span>
<span class="k">done</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Realistically, this should probably be a systemd service, but that&rsquo;s for another day.</p>
<h1 id="forwarding-ssh">Forwarding SSH</h1>
<p>For the time being, I mostly want to connect to my server for SSH. The easiest
option is to forward a port like <code>8192</code> on the proxy VM to port <code>22</code> on my local
server. Then I can simply add a small entry to <code>~/.ssh/config</code> and never worry about ports again:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">Host MyServer
    HostName my.vm.ip.here
    Port 8192
</code></pre></div><p>Now I can log in simply using <code>ssh MyServer</code>. The slightly more roundabout way
of achieving this is to make port <code>22</code> of the proxy forward to port <code>22</code> on my
server<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. This requires first changing the what port the <code>sshd</code> running
on the proxy will listen to. I&rsquo;ve chosen to make port <code>23</code> log in to the actual
VM whereas port <code>22</code> gets forwarded to my server.</p>
<p>First, open port <code>23</code> with <code>sudo iptables -w -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 23 -j ACCEPT</code>. Then add <code>Port 23</code> to <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code> and run <code>sudo service ssh restart</code>. Finally, change how you invoke the ssh reverse port forwarding as so:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">ssh -N -R <span class="s2">&#34;*:22:localhost:22&#34;</span> root@your.vm.ip.here -p <span class="m">23</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This will drive <code>ssh</code> a little crazy because it detects that it connected to a
different computer than expected. I suppose this is quite literally a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack">man-in-the-middle attack</a>, which <code>ssh</code> tries to prevent. You&rsquo;ll have to remove a
few lines from <code>~/.ssh/known_hosts</code> to quell things.</p>

<p>You could chose the other way around: to set the software firewall to
accept all traffic and to then filter things using your provider&rsquo;s network
firewall. Google&rsquo;s web interface is terribly slow so I have not chosen this.
One could also just set both firewalls to accept all traffic. Probably not a
good idea. <a href="#fnref:3" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
