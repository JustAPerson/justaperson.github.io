This is a collection of notes I've taken or commentary on documents I've found,
all collected and sorted by topic.

- [Performance](/wiki/perf/): Modern processors are very complex devices that
  have many special features designed for running applications faster. These
  features can provide speed ups for existing applications completely unaware of
  their existence. However, an intelligently written program can perform even
  better by specifically exploiting these processor features.

- [Compilers](/wiki/compilers) transform code into an executable
  program. There is complexity in both understanding and reasoning about the
  code, but the most complex parts of compilers deal with producing the most
  efficient output possible.

- [x86](/wiki/x86) yeet.
