    <h2 id="denuocc-2019"><a href="https://github.com/JustAPerson/denuocc">DenuoCC</a> (2019)</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/JustAPerson/denuocc">DenuoCC</a> is my second attempt at a C compiler. Currently I am working on the
front end, including the preprocessor, a backtracking recursive-descent parser,
comprehensive error messages, and thorough unit tests.</p>
<h2 id="vos-2015"><a href="https://github.com/JustAPerson/vos">VOS</a> (2015)</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/JustAPerson/vos">VOS</a> was my first venture in writing my own operating system. I didn't get
very far, as I was consumed by the minutia of trying to get Rust to compile for
16 bit protected mode--<a href="https://github.com/JustAPerson/vos/blob/rust_boot/makefile">going so far as recompiling many of the core libraries
myself</a>. Perhaps the most interesting part of this project is the
reasonably complete and well documented <a href="https://github.com/JustAPerson/vos/blob/master/src/lib/disk/src/fs/fat.rs">FAT filesystem implementation</a>
I planned to use.</p>
<h2 id="denuos-2016"><a href="https://github.com/JustAPerson/denuos">Denuos</a> (2016)</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/JustAPerson/denuos">Denuos</a> was my second attempt at writing my own operating system. This time I
got substantially farther. Some features implemented so far: basic VGA
rendering, keyboard and timer interrupts handled via PIC, dynamically allocated
memory, and the beginnings of a system call interface with working transitions
between privilege levels.</p>
<h2 id="luacrypt-2012"><a href="https://github.com/JustAPerson/LuaCrypt">LuaCrypt</a> (2012)</h2>
<p>As I've written about <a href="/about/arcs/">elsewhere</a>, I have an interest in
cryptography. I tried several times to implement basic security primitives in
Lua (<a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=writing+your+own+crypto">despite what everyone says</a>). I only successfully finished
SHA2. Eventually some one ended up finding <a href="https://github.com/JustAPerson/LuaCrypt/issues/1">a bug in my code</a> much to my
surprise that anyone ever even found my code, let alone used it.</p>
<h2 id="lua-bytecode-interpreter-2012"><a href="https://github.com/JustAPerson/lbi">Lua Bytecode Interpreter</a> (2012)</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/JustAPerson/lbi">LBI</a> was a project initiated out of necessity. I began programming because
of an online game called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roblox">Roblox</a>, which can vaguely be described as a
platform for kids to create lego-like games that are scripted using Lua. Roblox
creators often utilized a technique of obfuscation whereby they uploaded their
scripts as precompiled bytecode in order to prevent introspection or
modification. This was a form of copy-protection because scripts were ran on the
user's computer and could be read from memory and then used to create a
competing game. In 2012, Roblox removed the <code>loadstring()</code> function that enabled
the loading of bytecode. Thus, by implementing this project I was hoping to
salvage scripts I and many others had already precompiled.</p>
<p>This functionality was removed because specially crafted bytecode can exploit
the internal state of the Lua virtual machine and potentially whatever C
application is using it. These attacks are documented <a href="https://www.corsix.org/content/lua-514-bug-recap">here</a>. I
attempted to apply some of these attacks to Roblox, but didn't find any C
functions that seemed exploitable. However, I did encounter several
modifications the Roblox developers had made to harden the VM, including adding
read-only tables (as an atomic type, not accomplished through <a href="https://www.lua.org/pil/13.html">metatables</a>).</p>
<p>I emailed one of the lead developers about both my findings and the original
documentation of these bugs on 22 August 2011. They largely ignored my findings
at the time because I had not actually found a useful way to exploit the game.
Almost exactly one year later, <a href="https://blog.roblox.com/2012/08/bye-bye-bytecode/">Roblox announced the removal of
<code>loadstring</code></a>. Someone else had found a Roblox API that was vulnerable
to this exploit.</p>
<h2 id="maximum-overdrive-system-2011"><a href="https://github.com/JustAPerson/MODS">Maximum Overdrive System</a> (2011)</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/JustAPerson/MODS">MODS</a> is a Lua bytecode assembler and disassembler.</p>
<h2 id="brainrust-2015"><a href="https://github.com/JustAPerson/brainrust">Brainrust</a> (2015)</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/JustAPerson/brainrust">Brainrust</a> is a simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck">Brainfuck</a> interpreter. It performs some
obvious reductions in repetitive instructions. Similarly, <a href="https://gist.github.com/JustAPerson/8fe97f1591153a070cc5">brain86</a> is a
trivial 60 line program I wrote to translate Brainfuck to x86 assembly.</p>
