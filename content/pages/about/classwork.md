# Fall 2018
- [6.172 Performance Engineering](https://learning-modules.mit.edu/class/index.html?uuid=/course/6/fa18/6.172#dashboard)
- [6.830 Database Systems](http://db.csail.mit.edu/6.830/)
- 6.UAT Oral Communication

# Spring 2018
- [6.886 Graph Analytics](https://people.csail.mit.edu/jshun/6886-s18/)

    Advanced topics in graph algorithms. Covering a mix of theoretic algorithm
    improvements, novel frameworks, and careful performance tuning, this course
    focused exclusively on running common graph algorithms on extremely large
    data sets. Students read and presented on a wide variety of papers and
    completed a final project.

- 21G.304 French IV

# Fall 2017

- [6.851 Advanced Datastructures](https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.851/fall17/)

    This class covered a wide variety of very niche datastructures, including:
    retroactive and cache-oblivious datastructures, van Emde Boa trees, range
    trees, splay trees, among many even more obscure structures.

- 21G.303 French III

# Spring 2017

- [6.035 Compilers](http://6.035.scripts.mit.edu/sp17/overview.html)

    In this class students implemented a simple, javascript-like, dynamic
    language. The labs consisted of writing first the parser, a bytecode
    interpreter, a mark-sweep garbage collector, and a just-in-time compiler.
    
- 6.046 Advanced Algorithms

    This class builds on 6.006 and covers the following topics: the fast fourier
    transform, union-find, minimum spanning tree, max flow/min cut, linear
    programming, perfect hashing, gradient descent optimization, and further
    dynamic programming techniques.

- [6.033 Computer Systems Engineering](http://mit.edu/6.033/www/general.shtml)
- 6.041 Probability
- 21M.301 Harmony and Counterpoint
- 21G.302 French II

# Fall 2016

- [6.828 Operating Systems](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2016/overview.html)

    Before taking this class, I already had two serious attempts at writing my own
    operating system. I spent a lot of time learning the intricate details of the
    x86 IBM PC boot process, but did not get to many of the core ideas of what
    constitutes an operating system.

    This class had a [variety of fascinating readings][828read]. However, at the
    core this was a project class. The staff had written xv6, a very small early
    Unix clone, and for this class they had removed several key components. Each
    of the labs involved reimplementing one of the following key features: the
    virtual memory subsystem, the transition between privilege levels, the
    systemcall interface, a simple process scheduler, a rudimentary journaling
    filesystem, and an intel network interface driver (where the actual TCP
    processing was provided by a userspace driver that used an existing network
    library)

- [6.006 Algorithms](https://learning-modules.mit.edu/class/index.html?uuid=/course/6/fa16/6.006#dashboard)

    Covered basic computer science topics such as asymptotic time complexity,
    basic data structures (vectors, balanced binary trees, heaps, hashtables),
    dynamic programming, and basic graph algorithms (BFS/DFS, Djikstra's, Single
    Source Shortest Path).
