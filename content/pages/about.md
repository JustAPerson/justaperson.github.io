I'm Jason Priest. I study Computer Science at MIT, with a focus on Systems
Programming. You can read more about my [projects here](/about/projects/), or my
[classwork here](/about/classwork/). I began programming sometime around 2008,
but the earliest [written code I can find dates back to 2010](/about/arcs/).
